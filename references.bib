  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards
               (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a
               constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We
               emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading
               conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is
               particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups.
               METHODS: We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic
               factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer
               with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node
               involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of
               hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered.
               RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed
               metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all
               factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic
               factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH
               assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model.
               Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but although
               its effect diminished over time, it remained strong.
               Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show any
               significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided strong
               evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect over time.
               Negative HRec status increased the risk of metastases early but
               became protective thereafter. This reversal of effect may
               explain non-significant hazard ratios provided by previous
               conventional Cox analyses in studies with long follow-ups.
               CONCLUSIONS: Investigating time-varying effects should be an
               integral part of Cox survival analyses. Detecting and accounting
               for time-varying effects provide insights on some specific time
               patterns, and on valuable biological information that could be
               missed otherwise.",
