  abstract     = {Time-varying covariance occurs when a covariate changes over
                  time during the follow-up period. Such variable can be
                  analyzed with the Cox regression model to estimate its effect
                  on survival time. For this it is essential to organize the
                  data in a counting process style. In situations when the
                  proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model
                  does not hold, we say that the effect of the covariate is
                  time-varying. The proportional hazards assumption can be
                  tested by examining the residuals of the model. The rejection
                  of the null hypothesis induces the use of time varying
                  coefficient to describe the data. The time varying coefficient
                  can be described with a step function or a parametric time
                  function. This article aims to illustrate how to carry out
                  statistical analyses in the presence of time-varying
                  covariates or coefficients with R.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards
                  (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a
                  constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We
                  emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading
                  conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is
                  particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups.
                  METHODS: We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic
                  factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer
                  with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node
                  involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of
                  hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered.
                  RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed
                  metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all
                  factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic
                  factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH
                  assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model.
                  Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but
                  although its effect diminished over time, it remained strong.
                  Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show
                  any significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided
                  strong evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect
                  over time. Negative HRec status increased the risk of
                  metastases early but became protective thereafter. This
                  reversal of effect may explain non-significant hazard ratios
                  provided by previous conventional Cox analyses in studies with
                  long follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Investigating time-varying
                  effects should be an integral part of Cox survival analyses.
                  Detecting and accounting for time-varying effects provide
                  insights on some specific time patterns, and on valuable
                  biological information that could be missed otherwise.},
